# -URL-Question-Answering-System

The URL Based query system is designed to allow users to extract information from a 
specified web page and ask questions about its content. The system fetches the text from the 
URL provided by the user, processes it to generate embeddings, and utilizes a language model 
to generate answers based on user queries. This application integrates natural language 
processing (NLP) and vector database technologies to facilitate effective information 
retrieval.
